            <p>The Walt Disney World Resort (also known as Walt Disney World or Disney World) is an entertainment resort
                complex located about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando, Florida, United States. Opened on October
                1, 1971, the resort is operated by Disney Experiences, a division of The Walt Disney Company. The
                property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39 sq mi; 101 km2), of which half has been developed.[4] Walt
                Disney World contains numerous recreational facilities designed to attract visitors for an extended
                stay, including four theme parks, two water parks, four golf courses, conference centers, a competitive
                sports complex and a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex. Additionally, there are 19
                Disney-owned resort hotels and one camping resort on the property, and many other non-Disney-operated
                resorts on and near the property.</p>

            <p>In 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual
                attendance of more than 58 million.[6] The resort is the largest single-site employer in the United
                States,[3] the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise[7] and has become a
                popular staple in American culture.</p>

            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            <p>In the first year of opening, the park attracted 10,712,991 visitors.[86] In 2018, the resort's four
                theme parks all ranked in the top 9 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world: (1st)
                Magic Kingdom—20,859,000 visitors; (6th) Disney's Animal Kingdom—13,750,000 visitors; (7th)
                Epcot—12,444,000 visitors; and (9th) Disney's Hollywood Studios—11,258,000 visitors.[6] By October 2020,
                maximum Disney World attendance was still allowed to only remain at 25% capacity due to the COVID-19
                pandemic.[30] A recent study found that reducing Magic Kingdom park capacity to 25% would result in a
                54.1% reduction in annual attendance. This capacity limit causes less annual revenue, and may lower the
                number of visitors to the Orlando region.[87]</p>

            <h2>Operations</h2>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>The Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system
                allowing guest access across the property. The fare-free system utilizes buses, monorails, gondola
                lifts, watercraft, and parking lot trams.
            </p>
            <img src="img/monorail.jpg" alt="Monorail System at Walt Disney World">

            <p>The Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World; guests can board
                the monorail and travel between the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, including select on-property resorts such
                as The Grand Floridian and The Polynesian Village. The system operates on three routes that interconnect
                at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. Disney
                Transport owns a fleet of Disney-operated buses on the property, that is also complimentary for
                guests.[102]
            </p>

            <p>A gondola lift system, dubbed Disney Skyliner, opened in 2019. The system's three lines connect Disney's
                Hollywood Studios and Epcot with four resort hotels.[103]
            </p>

            <p>Disney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries
                that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also
                responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between
                the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.
            </p>

            <h3>Energy use</h3>
            <p>
                Walt Disney World requires an estimated 1 billion kilowatt-hours (3.6 billion megajoules) of electricity
                annually, costing the company nearly $100 million in annual energy consumption.[106] In addition to
                relying primarily on fossil fuels and nuclear energy from the state's power grid, Walt Disney World has
                two solar energy facilities on property; a 22-acre (0.034 sq mi; 0.089 km2) Mickey Mouse-shaped solar
                panel farm near Epcot, and a 270-acre (0.42 sq mi; 1.1 km2) facility near Disney's Animal Kingdom.[107]
                The larger facility produces enough solar energy to provide electricity to two of the resort's theme
                parks. The sites are operated by Duke Energy and the Reedy Creek Improvement District,
                respectively.[107]
            </p>

            <p>The entire Disney Transport bus fleet uses R50 renewable diesel fuel, obtained from used cooking oil and
                non-consumable food waste from the resort.[107]</p>

            <h3>Self-Government and security</h3>

            <p>Disney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the
                personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since September 11, 2001, uniformed security has
                been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks.
                Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways
                and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the
                walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving at the Transportation and Ticket Center by
                tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort
                hotel bus or Minnie Van have their own bag check just outside the bus stops. Guests arriving via Magic
                Kingdom Resort boat launch are bag checked on the arrival dock outside Magic Kingdom.[108]</p>

            <h3>Corporate culture</h3>

            <p>Walt Disney World's corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology.[117][118] For example,
                park visitors are always "guests", employees are called "cast members", rides are "attractions" or
                "experiences", cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their
                faces are known as "face characters", jobs are "roles", and public and nonpublic areas are respectively
                labeled "onstage" and "backstage".[117][118]</p>
